# Titanic-Logistic-Regression--Coding-Ninjas
Performed Logistic Regression ( for Classification between two classes that is Survived and Dead) for Titanic Dataset. 
We here shape and arrange our TRAIN and TEST datasets.
Later we split the TRAIN dataset into x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test and apply Logistic Regression algorithm.
Algorithm gives 0.79 score on x_test,y_test.
Then we apply this algorithm on TEST dataset and predict Y.
